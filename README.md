This is a decentralized exchange that I copied from LearnWeb3DAO but modified it so I can create an unlimited amount of liquidity pools.

Before it was just one contract that can only handle one pair. I made it into a contract that creates pool contracts which speak to the main contract.
let me know what you think!
