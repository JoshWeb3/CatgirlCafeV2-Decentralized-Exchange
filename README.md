**This is a decentralized exchange that I forked from LearnWeb3DAO but modified it so I can create an unlimited amount of liquidity pools which can support ERC20/ETH & ERC20/ERC20 pairs. And also I made it look like a dating simulator where you visit an anime catgirl cafe**
let me know what you think!


**1. Exchange.sol**
(creates and manages pool pairs)
1. Contract owner sets foundation address
2. ETH/token, and token/token pairs can be created using the dex contract
3. All swaps incur a 1% fee that goes to donations to a foundation.
4. Users can supply and remove liquidity from the pool contracts.
